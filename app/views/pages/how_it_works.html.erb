		R&D has a unique process to create dope products inspired by the music of our community’s favorite artists. Each experiment is themed for a specific artist, music project and/or partnership. The community submits and votes on their favorite lyrics. Artists submit designs inspired by the selected lyrics. Top designs are printed and sold for artists to be promoted and paid.
